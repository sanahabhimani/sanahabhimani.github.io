# Description

I'm a PhD Candidate in the Physics Department at Yale University, where I am advised by Laura Newburgh. Specifically, I'm an experimental cosmologist, working on the Simons Observatory (SO). SO is a cutting-edge experiment composed of 60,000 detectors across 4 telescopes that are currently being commissioned to the Atacama Desert in Chile. SO will use the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), relic radiation from the Big Bang, to measure the initial conditions and evolution of our universe. For SO, I have been involved in every stage of its development: constructing ~300 temperature sensors to measure temperature fluctuations of the detectors, I collaborate with over 300 physicists on pipeline data analysis, am a foundational developer of the Observatory Control System (OCS) which is a new software technology used for current and future CMB experiments to control, live monitor, and acquire data from the experiments' hardware components simultaneously. 

I also lead the DAQ deployment and commissioning of critical site instrumentation to establish instrument perforamnce metrics for stably operating all 4 telescopes in the Atacama Desert. This year (2023), I went to Chile to help setup network computing at the site in March and helped commission our first Small Aperture Telescope (SAT) in September. I'll be going back in Spring 2024 for commissioning purposes, but as part of DAQ, we're typically the first ones in for deployment and the last ones out so we try to balance deploying critical things remotely and in-person. I thrive in a diverse environment with access to so many different mindsets and I believe that's why I have been able to pivot back and forth so successfully between hardware and software in my PhD. 

For fun, I love going on adventures with my 4 year old Chihuahua mix named Etta, hiking, yoga, car shows/races, watching basketball and F1, and going on road trips. I'm a bit of an adrenaline junkie who likes skydiving and fast cars; I'm hoping to go hang-gliding soon! I'm an avid reader, am big on community service and outreach, and am recently becoming quite addicted to strength training. I love learning new languages---I grew up multilingual---and am almost always looking for opportunities to practice in real-life scenarios!
